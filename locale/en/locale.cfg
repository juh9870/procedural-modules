procedural-modules-highest-tier=Highest tier of the module to add
procedural-modules-recipe-exponent=Amount of modules of previous tier used in crafting
procedural-modules-allow-module-crafting-productivity=Allow productivity for module crafting

[mod-setting-description]
procedural-modules-highest-tier=The highest tier to create for each of the vanilla modules\nNote: if module hits the cap on any of the effects (for example: max speed on the speed module) it will stop at that tier and generate no more. This usually only happens at the very high numbers with the vanilla module scaling
procedural-modules-recipe-exponent=-1 means the same as in the recipe of tier 3 module\nSetting this to 1 will trivialize getting to the highest tier by removing the exponential crafting requirements
procedural-modules-allow-module-crafting-productivity=Allows productivity modules to be used when crafting both new modules and the preexisting tier 1-3 modules\nAlllowed productivity will be capped to not allow getting more of higher tier modules than the lower tier ones, but this setting will still trivialize getting to the highest tier by removing the exponential crafting requirements
